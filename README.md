### UW CFRM 462 - Computational Finance and Econometrics Final Project

This repository contains the source code for my final paper for [CFRM 462](http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/econ424/econ424.htm), a class on Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics, taught by [Professor Eric Zivot](http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/), at the [University of Washington](http://washington.edu/) during Summer Quarter 2016.

The project focuses on creating mathematically optimized portfolios, comprising 6 mutual funds, which track both equity and debt assets. This project was written in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), R and LaTeX.

The source code of this project (`source_code.R`) is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/rukmal/UW-CFRM-462-Portfolio-Optimization/blob/master/LICENSE).
